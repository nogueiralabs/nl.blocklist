# nogueiralabs blocklist
We provide a hosts file with a list of malicious sites, trackers, and advertisements.  **Imagine a better Internet...**

We estimate that up to 22% of our lab bandwidth could be saved by blocking connection to ads and trackers. This also results in faster page loading because there are fewer files to be downloaded by the browser, more secure, and most importantly, a more private navigation.




## How to use

We recomend using Pi-hole, but any hosts editor will work.
You just need to download the blocklist file or redirect (Pi-hole).
